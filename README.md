# Final Lab for Data Structures
The final lab for course in data structures. Utilized unit tests and Unified Modeling Language to plan execution in advance.

Lab utilized an uninformed search to compare an Iterative Deepening search with a Breadth-First Search of an tree of possibilities. These possibilities were "twisting", "poking", "shaking", or "pulling" a hash (TheLock object), in any sequence, in order to open it.
Discussion was also made about a permutative approach, but was not a part of the execution.

Unit tests were conducted on locks of size 2-14, five times each, so that an average could be pulled for comparing the operation's: time to complete, number of nodes traversed; and number of items in the stack or queue upon finishing the process. This was executed through: starting a timer, then creating a TheLock object with a unique string arguments. Then an ID search or BF search was conducted, with appropriate data outputted for the number of nodes traversed and items remaining in the temporary structure. Finally, the end time was recorded and shown to the screen. Unfortunately, the test file was not transferred from a computer on which it was created.
